# Intro
Welcome to ACME Corp!
We're so happy you could start a week early!
We got the approval for your team's hiring spend, but don't want to 
start connecting to people on LinkedIn until you decided on the platform
to help us with our search.

Can you get back to us with the tech stack by the end of the day?

We know this is your first Lead role since being a senior engineer, 
but we're sure you're going to nail it! We are so happy that you joined us as 
everyone else who applied was asking for a lot more money and outside of our budget.

Hey thanks for getting back to us so quickly!
I pushed out the three job reqs: a Lead to help you, a 
VP and a desktop support technician.

We weren't sure what you meant about "CI/CD" so we searched CI/CD and used one
that seemed familiar from past postings: Team Foundation Server - works for you,
right?

# The New VP
The new VP has negotiated a fantastic deal with Oracle Cloud!
Based on our current runway, they'd like you to switch from
$CLOUD to Oracle Cloud by end of next week. 

Don't worry about other deliverables, saving money is the most
important thing right now. Anyway, should just be a couple of 
days work - they're just clouds, right?
